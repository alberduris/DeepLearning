# R2RT - Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow (unofficial)

This repository contains the code presented in the <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-i.html">"Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow" tutorial series</a> by R2RT at <a href="https://r2rt.com">R2RT</a> with some personal additional explanations and updated references.

**This is NOT the OFFICIAL repository for the code. You can found the ORIGINAL code in the following posts**
 - <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-i.html">Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow I</a>
 - <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii.html">Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow II</a>
 - <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-iii-variable-length-sequences.html">Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow III</a>

I personally think that they're some of the best RNN-Tensorflow tutorial out there. Definitely, check them out, without them, this repository is useless.

## Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow I

A vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented from the ground up in Tensorflow, and then translate the model into Tensorflowâ€™s RNN Static & Dynamic API.

## Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow II

A MultiLSTM Recurrent Neural Network is built on Tensorflow based on the Vanilla model we previously implemented.

## Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow III

Several RNN models suited for Variable Sequence Length data are implemented in Tensorflow, including a simple Seq2Seq model.
