# Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow I

A vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN) is implemented from the ground up in Tensorflow, and then translate the model into Tensorflowâ€™s RNN Static & Dynamic API.

## VanillaRNN_Tensorflow.ipynb

In this notebook, we will build a vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN) from the ground up in Tensorflow. <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-i.html">Source</a>

## VanillaRNN_TensorFlow_Static.ipynb

In this notebook we will implement the same model of ``"VanillaRNN_Tensorflow.ipynb"`` but using the Tensorflow RNN Static API. <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-i.html">Source</a>

## VanillaRNN_TensorFlow_Dynamic.ipynb

In this notebook we will implement the **same** model of ``"VanillaRNN_Tensorflow.ipynb"`` but using the Tensorflow RNN Dynamic API. <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-i.html#using-a-dynamic-rnn">Source</a>

## Vanilla_RNN_TF_Dynamic_Clean.ipynb

Notebook with a "cleaner" (without explanations, examples, images...) of the last model, the one using the dynamic API.
