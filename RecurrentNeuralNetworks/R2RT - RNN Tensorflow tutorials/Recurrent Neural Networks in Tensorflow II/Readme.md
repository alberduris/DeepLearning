# Recurrent Neural Networks in Tensorflow II

A MultiLSTM Recurrent Neural Network is built on Tensorflow based on the Vanilla model we previously implemented.

## MultiLSTM.ipynb

In this notebook, we will build upon our vanilla RNN by learning how to use Tensorflowâ€™s scan and dynamic_rnn models, upgrading the RNN cell and stacking multiple RNNs, and adding dropout. We will then use our upgraded RNN to generate some text, character by character. <a href="https://r2rt.com/recurrent-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-ii">Source</a>
